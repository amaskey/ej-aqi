Environmental justice means the fair treatment of all people from environmental impacts, regardless of race, color, national origin, education level, or income. This code uses machine learning (ML) to model air quality disparities in Jefferson County, Alabama.
cnn-lstm-daily.ipynb is a Google Colab Notebook that implements the CNN-LSTM approach to train a model to predict AQI based on historical data and correlates with demographic information.
predicting-AQI-population-projection.ipynb is a Google Colab Notebook that uses the trained model to predict AQI values for projected population for future years.
The two curated datasets are daily-data-ml-ready.csv and population-projection-ml-ready.csv. The daily-data-ml-ready.csv file includes daily AQI for seven distinct locations in Jefferson County for the past nine years. It also incudes the computed AQI with relation to race demographics. The population-projection-ml-ready.csv file includes annual aggregation of AQI and projected population for race demographics.
